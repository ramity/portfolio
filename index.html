                board tasks, such as developing new features and fixing bugs,
                and working closely with the project owner, who is also a
                pilot, to ensure that investor expectations and needs are met.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                In this role, I have translated complex business logic into
                code, such as creating algorithms to match pilots with clients
                and implementing secure payment processing via stripe.

              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                As a teaching assistant for Programming Foundations I & II, I
                played a critical role in facilitating student learning and success.

                I guided three lab sessions, assisted in the creation of homework
                material, and provided grading support for approximately a hundred
                undergraduate students while also providing office hours for both
                courses.

                During office hours, I commonly answered questions regarding

                and compilation errors, and explained programming concepts
                discussed in lecture.

                I also collaborated with the courseinstructor to create lab
                materials and assignments, and gave guest lectures on occasion.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                One of the most rewarding aspects of this role was the opportunity
                to connect with students and provide individualized support.

                For example, I remember one student who was struggling with a
                particular concept and came to me for help.

                Together, we worked through some practice problems and I was
                able to explain the concept in a way that made sense to them.

                Seeing their understanding click into place was incredibly rewarding.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                Overall, my experience as a teaching assistant taught me the
                importance of clear communication and individualized support
                in promoting student success.

                I am excited to continue applying these skills in future endeavors.

                of patch recommendation and remediation as well as ensuring
                auditability to ensure compliance with federal guidelines.

                This required working closely with other developers and researchers
                to ensure that the ML algorithms were properly trained and optimized
                for the specific needs of the electrical infrastructure environment.

                Principally, any models or algorithms that were applied required
                verifiability and explaination as to why specific courses of action
                were reccommended.

                the successful deployment of the application.

                I also participated in code reviews, made suggestions for
                improvements, and helped to ensure the overall quality of the
                application met described standards.

                This work was part of a funded research project with a substantial
                contribution from the Department of Energy.

                As a member of the development team, I played a critical role in

              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                During my summer internship at Walmart's newly created Intelligent
                Automation Department on the Bentonville, AR campus, I developed a
                series of applications to extract, modify, view, and interact with
                data from paper receipts.

                With much of the produce grown in Latin America still coming with
                paper invoices, Walmart needed to digitize a vast amount of data.

                To help address and explore this need, I focused on developing
                spike implementations to demonstrate the possible speed increase
                of a human-moderated OCR system over a purely human data entry
                process.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                In addition to developing these spike implementations, I participated
                in meetings with external providers to gain insight into their
                solutions for creating a human-moderated OCR system.

                I also collaborated with Walmart's internal AI teams to evaluate
                the capacity of existing AI deployments and infrastructure.

                Throughout the internship, I presented and discussed my work in daily
                standup meetings, gaining valuable feedback from team members and leaders.

                I was also able to leverage my problem-solving skills and technical

              </h3>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                As a software developer for a company based in Bietigheim-Bissingen,
                Germany, in addition to brushing up on some german, I had the
                opportunity to work on a variety of projects for clients across
                different industries.

                I particularly enjoyed working on the many challenging projects
                that required creative problem-solving.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                One such project was a challenge hosted by BMW, where I contributed
                to an inventory system overhaul that was selected for utilization
                in a major manufacturing plant.

                Our solution consisted of a barcode scanning glove, programmable
                e-ink displays, and the integration with an existing MQTT system.

                I played a key role in the development of this system, which
                significantly modernized the part-request process for assembly
                lines and replaced a pen-and-paper solution.

                The project presented many unique challenges, such as only being
                provided limited, API-like details of the internal MQTT system at
                BMW and the need to integrate the custom, in-house hardware with
                a control system whilst simulatenously on simulatating a MQTT
                network.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                In another project, I contributed to a seed grant sponsored by the EU to
                enable public transit for rural towns in Germany.

                This project, dubbed "der bürgerbus" (the citizen bus), required a
                custom routing solution to allow for dynamic time and location
                scheduling of stops.

                I extended an open source routing engine "Project OSRM" to handle
                the dynamic constraints and developed a web user interface that
                allowed operators to view and modify proposed routing solutions in
                a intuiative manner.

                This was one of the most complex problems I have had the pleasure of
                programming.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">
                Largely, these experiences exposed me to a range of unique challenges
                and provided me with valuable experience in solving complex problems
                and developing creative solutions.

                They also taught me the importance of collaboration and communication
                in achieving project success.

                which streamlined operations and improved efficiency.

                Played a key role in improving the efficiency and productivity of the
                company by contributing to the development of several applications
                that were used by both internal and external stakeholders.

                These applications include, but are not limited to, an online
                registration and payment portal, a certification and grade record
                keeping service, a lab inspection service for ensuring compliance
                with state guidelines, and an equipment calibration record management
                system for securely storing and access for auditing purposes.

                These contributions helped the company to better serve its clients,
                reduce administrative overhead, and improve accuracy and timeliness
                of its operations.

            A homework assignment I was responsible for creating during my teaching assistantship.
            It builds upon the lore established by other homework assignments and walks the students
            through building a series of OOP class definitions. After completion, students use some
            provided method logic and apply brute force to decrypt provided transaction data.

          During my time as a student at the University of Arkansas, I came to know Lewis as a fellow student, friend, and
          co-worker. We both shared the same enrollment and graduation dates, and as a result often took classes with one
          another. I met him during my first semester freshman year, and teamed up together on group projects. I had most classes
          with him throughout my undergraduate studies, and we worked at the same place outside of class for two and a half years.
        
          I've always known Lewis to be a highly motivated and dedicated student. It was early into our friendship that I learned
          he was working to put himself through school. One quality about Lewis that stood out to me was that he was able to use
          his knowledge to help others learn. I could always rely on him to go in depth with examples and explanations of any
          topic he had experience in. During our large group projects in software engineering and capstone projects his
          contributions highly influenced our ability to deliver software solutions in a timely manner. During both of these
          projects, Lewis took upon the role of project leader to help allocate work in a fair manner and working wherever
          additional help was needed. Particularly during our capstone II project, his working knowledge of opencv and tesseract
          enabled our team to implement custom scene recognition for navigation and block identification in a timely manner. We
          were frequently hit with delays and other unexpected problems that were usually out of our control. Our team often
          looked to Lewis to give updated estimates of requested features to our electrical engineering contacts. Like all
          projects, scope creep became a serious issue. I believe his previous development experience allowed us to deliver
          completed solutions rather than uncompleted.
        
          Lewis is not without fault. He has always had a talent for explaining complex concepts simply, but sometimes
          ironically dwells on optimizing solutions far past their needed requirements. In high pressure situations Lewis will bite off
          more than he can chew. During our final capstone II project, due to him having a much higher expertise in computer vision,
          he had tasked himself with a majority of the difficult procedures we had to come up with. Although he was able to deliver
          in the end, I believe he could benefit from working alongside teammates more during the beginning of a project, so
          that the final product isn't as rushed and to take a load of the work off of himself.
        
          With all the development work Lewis took part in during his undergraduate studies, it is hard not to notice how focused
          and driven he is when he gets the opportunity to work on a project. Through his prior knowledge, freelancing experience,
          and web development experience at work, Lewis was always able to take leadership roles in the projects we worked on
          together. As with most successful leaders, Lewis was able to lend a hand to help the other members of our teams when
          we were struggling.
        
          It is, without a doubt, that Lewis will bring a sizable contribution to our field. Lewis longs for the chance to show
          what he's capable of.

          Lewis Brown is very decisive and goal-oriented student whom has made his mark on the
          Freshman Engineering Program (FEP). I have had the ultimate pleasure of mentoring Lewis
          Brown during this academic year via the FEP peer mentorship program. It is very evident to me
          that Lewis has an adamant interest in the field of Computer Science and Computer Engineering
          here at the University of Arkansas. As an experienced undergraduate with a degree in computer
          science and pursuing another degree in computer engineering, I can truly vouch for Lewis'
          talents and interests in this field.
        
          During the course of our mentorship, Lewis stands out as an individual who is prepared to face
          the academic and mental challenges the University and College of Engineering has to offer.
          Every meeting I have conducted with him, he exudes a sense of comfort and confidence without
          being prideful. He is always yearning to listen and is highly respectful. He is a quintessential
          University of Arkansas student. Lewis comes well prepared for meetings, being very punctual
          believing that "being early is on-time and being on-time is late." In addition, Mr. Brown shows
          great aptitude for research work in computer science, and is looking forward to working under
          our plethora of highly qualified engineering professors.
        
          I have a great deal of respect for Lewis Brown and I have no doubt that he will be successful in
          the goals he decides to pursue. With this scholarship being one of his goals, he will work extra
          hard to receive and keep this honor. It's highly likely that many professors will have similarly
          positive experience with Lewis in his succeeding years at this university. He will not let you down!

          I've come to admire the passionate and relentless student that Lewis is. Countless times I've watched him get home
          from work only to continue homework and projects long into the night. During his time interning for Walmart he would
          prioritize his work and sleep over games and socializing when he would have to wake up at five in the morning for his
          commute. Naturally, his vast and growing knowledge of computer science has made him a leader among his friends and
          colleagues, one who loves helping and teaching even if it takes hours to find a solution to someone's problem.
        
          At home, I usually find Lewis making finely detailed financial budgeting spreadsheets in excel for himself, and he
          frequently offers to make them for me and other people. He also spends a lot of time finding ways to maximize the
          efficiency of anything he does, whether it's hot keys for programs, or personal hobbies such as finding the best
          formula to generate maximum resources in a game.
        
          Like any student, Lewis has his personal shortcomings. One of his setbacks would be the plethora of unfinished
          personal projects I've seen him set aside for new projects because he doesn't have enough time to see them to completion.
          In his stubborn ways, he has lingered relentlessly over difficult problems in hopes of improving existing solutions.
