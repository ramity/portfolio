            Hello! I'm Lewis Brown, a machine learning engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions using cutting-edge technologies. With 3+ years of commercial and academic experience in the field, I have a strong background in designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models for a range of applications.
          </p>
          <p class="m-0 mb-5 ti-3">
            Throughout my career in software, I've worked on a variety of projects that involved developing models for image recognition, object detection and localization, and limited computation, edge device environments. I'm skilled in a range of programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java, and have experience working with a variety of frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Keras.
          </p>
          <p class="m-0 mb-5 ti-3">
            With my academic research background, I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and have a keen interest in exploring new research and techniques. One of my most exciting projects to date was applying my thesis work to an edge computing evironment without the use of a ML library, which required a high degree of persistence, investigation, and creativity to execute.
          </p>
          <p class="m-0 mb-5 ti-3">
            In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and interests. I'm an avid reader and spend a lot of time online reading articles and books about a variety of topics. I'm also passionate about strength training, which helps me stay physically and mentally fit. When I'm not working out or reading, I enjoy programming and building personal projects. I find it both challenging and rewarding to create something from scratch and bring my ideas to life. To facilitate this, I have a home lab where I can deploy and utilize various software environments. I also enjoy building and customizing computers and commonly do so for many of my friends. Lastly, I'm an avid gamer and love to challenge myself with difficult games. These hobbies help me unwind and keep my mind engaged outside of work.
          </p>
          <p class="m-0 ti-3">
            If you're looking for a talented and driven machine learning engineer to help take your projects to the next level, I'd love to hear from you. Please feel free to get in touch to learn more about my experience and skills.

              <p class="card-text ti-3">Much of the produce grown in Latin America comes with paper rather than digital invoices. The quantity of paper data Walmart interacts with requires a herculean effort to digitize, and to meet this requirement, Walmart employs a significantly large workforce dedicated purely to data entry. Much of my work consisted of developing spike implementations to demonstrate the possible speed increase of a human moderated OCR system over a purely human data entry process. I additionally sat in on meetings to gain more insight on external providers solutions for creating a human moderated OCR system, detailed and discussed my work in daily standup meetings, and collaborated with Walmart's internal AI teams to evaluate the capacity of existing AI deployments and infrastructure.</p>

              <p class="card-text ti-3">Contributed to an inventory system overhaul in a challenge hosted by BMW which was selected for utilization in a major manufacturing pant. The system consisted of a barcode scanning glove, programmable e-ink displays, and interaction with an existing MQTT system for querying existing inventories for requested and required parts. Our implementation significantly modernized the part-request process for assembly lines and replaced a pen-and-paper solution. The solution made the job of pulling parts from storage incredibly intuitive: requested parts were highlighted by a green light on the display (and only then was a barcode was displayed), the barcode was scanned via glove, and placed on the line. The glove sent the scanned barcode data to a locally networked MQTT broker, was processed by the inventory management system, and refreshed displays to highlight the next requested part (default state of red light and no displayed barcode). The project had many unique challenges. We were only API-like details of the internal MQTT system at BMW. Additionally, all the hardware mentioned above was created in-house and required integration (gloves and displays to a control system on a simulated MQTT network). Lastly, all remote without physical access for testing.</p>
              <p class="card-text ti-3">Contributed to a multi-bus public transit system dubbed "der bürgerbus" (the citizen bus) in a seed grant sponsored by the EU for enabling public transit for rural towns in Germany. It required a custom routing solution to allow for dynamic time and location scheduling of stops. Most of my work consisted of extending "Project OSRM" to handle the dynamic constraints mentioned above and allow operators to view and modify with the proposed routing solutions via a web user interface. Probably the most complicated problem I've had the pleasure of programming.</p>
